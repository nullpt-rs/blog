# nullpt.rs

Technical blog with ideas from various authors. 

#### Creating a new post

Creating a post is fairly simple, you just need to create a mdx file `src/posts/<year>/<month number>/<post-name>.mdx` and start with this header:

```md
---
slug: slug-for-the-post
date: Aug 1 2023
author: authorname
name: Your Amazing Post Title
excerpt: A beautiful summary of the blog post
keywords: comma,separated,keyword,list
---
```

And continue writing using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) :)
